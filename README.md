# Summary #

##  Mission Statement : ##

To help contribute to building the infrastructure of VR/AR to help power the next computing platform that faciliates the seamless interaction
of trade, commerce, and culture in XR. 

##  Purpose : ##

One of the biggest problems I've had is not having access to a drag & drop grid where I can snap/unsnap objects in both virtual & augmented reality.

For many of the enterprise XR experiences I am building, I need a 3D grid to spatially organize much of the 3D prefabs that I am placing into
the 3D world I am creating.

Rather than recreate a new grid every time I am creating a new enterprise XR app, I hope to release this grid such that it can be used for
frequent usage.

# Features : # 

1) Drag and Drop: 

2) Table Mode: In VR/AR, especially with tetherless HMDs, you may be dealing with spaces with seemingly infinite scale. Toggle on and off a 
table that has access to the grid coordinates of 

3) Menu Mode: Have access to a list of prefabs to test the drag and dropping of objects. In the future, this will have access to Google Poly
or Sketchfab
