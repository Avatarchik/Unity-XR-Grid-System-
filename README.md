# Summary #

##  Mission Statement : ##

To help contribute to building the infrastructure of VR/AR to help power the next computing platform that faciliates the seamless interaction
of trade, commerce, and culture in XR. 

##  Purpose : ##

One of the biggest problems I've had is not having access to a drag & drop grid where I can snap/unsnap objects in both virtual & augmented reality.

For many of the enterprise XR experiences I am building, I need a 3D grid to spatially organize much of the 3D prefabs that I am placing into the 3D world I am creating.

Rather than recreate a new grid every time I am creating a new enterprise XR app, I hope to release this grid such that it can be used for frequent usage.

# Features : # 

1) Drag and Drop: Drag & drop, snap objects onto the table OR the world grid. 

2) Table Mode: In VR/AR, especially with tetherless HMDs, you may be dealing with spaces with seemingly infinite scale. Toggle on and off a table that has access to the grid coordinates of the world space. Drag and drop the object in table space, and the object will appear in world space. 

3) Menu Mode: Have access to a list of prefabs to test the drag and dropping of objects. In the future, this will have access to Google Poly or Sketchfab 3D Models.

# Instructions #

1) Install the most recent Package Manager for the Unity XR Grid System. 

2) Place the GridManager Prefab and two Grid Prefabs onto the Unity Hierarchy.

3) For augmented reality, place the Menu Prefab Onto the Hierarchy. For virtual reality, check on or off for Virtual Reality.
This allows the
