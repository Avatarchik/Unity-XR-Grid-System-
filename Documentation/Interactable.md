# Interactable.cs #

Notes: provide methods that are connected to the TouchManaager to allow for different Gesture Interactions with the Touched, Grabbed, or Swipped Object. Use the Raycast from the Touch Manager (a Decoupled Component of ARKit from ViewController) to interact with the Raycast. 

// note -> Simulate difference between touch, grab, and throw. Use shaders to simulate procedural mesh / grabbing movement?
